# after_graduate_learning
This repository is made to record my daily coding.

Learn as you want.

Algorithms 

Machine learning  -- i think here i need to learn more thing about math

Java container and some base concepts.

parctice your coding ability

And this is also needed to learn some basic concept of the computer world,such as the net ,the operation system and so on.

But there is a serious question for me that i mostly cannot follow my own sechedule, so the biggest enemy is always yourself.
